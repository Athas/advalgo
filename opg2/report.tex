\section{Traveling Couple Problem}
For $d=0$ TCP is identical to TSP for all input graphs. And for $d > 0$
there will always be graphs where the minimum vertice distance is
greater than $d$, in which case the problem is again equivalent to TSP, which
is known NP-complete. Therefore we cannot say wether TCP is solvable in
polynomial time.
\section{Tweak-method}
\begin{itemize}
\item The optimal datastructure is an ordered set of vertices.
Implemented in a programming language it could be either a linked list
or an indexed array.
\item $V$ is intialised to the empty set. We then start by choosing an arbitrary vertice $v$ and add it to the set $V$. 
Afterwards we take another arbitrary vertice not in the set $V$ and not
within the distance $d$ from a node in $V$. Repeat this until no such nodes are left.
\item We take two arbitrary edges $(u_1,v_1)$ and $(u_2,v_2)$ and
replace them with $(u_1,u_2)$ and $(v_1,v_2)$. The switch of directions
is propagated through the subgraph that connects $v_1$ and $u_2$, in the form of reversing the list.
\item We take a vertice $v$ from the set $V$ and look at all vertices within
range $d$ of $v$. We then choose an arbitrary vertice $u$ from this set
and check if it is possible to replace $u$ with $v$ and still have all
nodes covered.

\end{itemize}
\section{Tabu-search}
We have implemented a feature-based Tabu-search, that uses the altered nodes in the tweak procedure,
as its tabu-elements, making tabu any tweak that includes changing such a vertice.
This requires all tweaks to keep a list of nodes it alters and return it to the algorithm.
The algorithm then keeps this list, being subject to the length contraint $l$, and discards all tweaks that return
a node currently in the tabu-list.

The results using Tabu-search are significantly better than Hill-climbing, which is primarily caused by
tabus more explorative nature, which means it will look at a larger sample, and is more likely to find
any solution. This, however is not unlike a simple steepest-ascent algorithm, in which the algorithm
also considers a larger neighborhood than hillclimbing. This shows as the result-difference between a
tabu-search and steepest-ascent in our case shows little difference in results.

\section{Best solution}
We have found a tour of length $23.1677$, using feature-based Tabu-search with a $n=20,l=30$ distribution.\\
